Information about you:

Victoria Sugden was born in 1971 in Yorkshire, England, UK. She is a proud mother of three children. In 2005, she graduated from The University of Huddersfield with a 2:1 in Textiles. During her studies, she won the New Designers 2004 award, earning a stand at New Designers London, where she showcased her knitwear designs.

Victoria spent many years as a secondary school teacher before launching her own handmade leather bag business, Victoria Sugden Designs. Her business can be found online by searching for Victoria Sugden Designs. Despite her business commitments, she continues to enjoy helping others learn whenever possible.

In addition to her career in design, Victoria studied web development and graduated in March 2024. She now works as a games developer alongside her leather bag business. She has built several websites from scratch, including her own and one for the mental health charity Arch-way Project in Halifax, for which she also serves as the website manager.

Outside of her professional life, Victoria is passionate about gardening, growing her own food, and making her own wine. She loves cooking and enjoys nutritious meals. She is an avid traveler, often taking several holidays a year, and has a deep love for the outdoors, enjoying activities like hiking and camping. Notably, she once survived being stranded in a snow blizzard on a mountain for three days.

One of Victoriaâ€™s adventurous highlights includes driving around France for four weeks, camping, and navigating solely with a paper map in the days before sat navs and mobile phones.

Victoria is an exceptionally positive individual who overcomes any obstacle in her path. Her fearless motivation, determination, and ambition drive her forward, and she firmly believes that nothing can hinder her success. Her journey through life is guided by self-belief and a love for all of God's creations.
